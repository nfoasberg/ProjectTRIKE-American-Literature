# Introduction

## The Data

This project analzyes metadata for journal articles. Metadata is usually data about data -- but in this project, it's the focus of the work! Before we dive in, I want to consider the kinds of questions metadata might help to answer, and to provide some more information about the contexts from which the data is drawn (_MLA International Bibliography_ and _American Literature_).

## Research Questions

Although it is important to select your data with some knowledge of the questions you want to answer with it, research questions are still likely to shift over time, based on what you see in the data. When this happens, it's important to revisit the initial questions and think about whether the new questions can be answered using the same data.

In this case, I began gathering data with these questions in mind:

    1. How had the canon of American literature changed in the twentieth century? Are scholars writing about different authors now than they did previously? Is more attention being paid to women authors and authors of color? 
    2. Criticism changed drastically over the course of the twentieth century, with the emergence of many different schools of criticism. Are these differences visible from the metadata and subject indexing of the journal?
    3. How has the indexing in MLA shifted over time?  I expect to see more subject terms per citation, but will I see different ones?

Note that several of these questions are bigger than the data that I've chosen to answer them. The question of canon in American literature will not be answered by one journal!  It also doesn't represent the breadth of the Bibliography. 

However, looking at one journal has its virtues:

    * Issues of a journal are likely to be similar in both subject matter and length.  I don't have to worry about comparing a journal that publishes 20 articles in an issue to one that publishes 4, or comparing a journal that's published quarterly to one that's only published anually.
    * Changes in this journal reflect what's happening between that journal and its readership. Suppose, for instance, that the number of different journals published has risen sharply at some point.  Many of the changes I'd see in the data would be because more journals are being published, and each of those journals would likely have a slightly different scope, readership, or editorial policies.  Note that I don't totally avoid this problem by sticking with one journal, as authors make choices about where to publish their work which are likely to be influenced by the other options available to them.
    * The amount of data I will collect is much more manageable.

So this makes sense as a place to start. In no case will a single project answer all of its own questions definitively! We work in the hope that others will find these questions interesting, and work on related projects that may also contribute to answer our questions.

## _MLA International Bibliography_

MLAIB is an index maintained by the Modern Language Association, a scholarly association for the study of language and literature. The index has strong coverage of the scholarly literature in these areas, including journals, books, and disserations. Coverage goes back to the 1920s.  Each entry includes specific metadata. Basic bibliographic information, including title, author, source, and ISSN or ISBN, is part of each record, along with "document information," including language, publication type, and accession number. 

Additionally, each record includes a number of subject terms, which describe the content of the item described.  These subject terms, too, are structured.  Possible categories of subject terms include: subject literature (that is, national literature), period (by century), subject author, subject work, and subject terms describing the ideas and themes which the work describes.  

Let's look at one example. This is part of the record for the following journal article:
Stadler, Gustavus. "Louisa May Alcott's Queer Geniuses." American Literature: A Journal of Literary History, Criticism, and Bibliography, vol. 71, no. 4, 1999, pp. 657-77.

Title: Louisa May Alcott's Queer Geniuses
Authors: Stadler, Gustavus
Source: American Literature: A Journal of Literary History, Criticism, and Bibliography (AL) 1999 Dec; 71 (4): 657-77.  [Journal Detail]
Peer Reviewed: Yes
...
General Subject Areas:
Subject Literature: American literature
Period: 1800-1899
Primary Subject Author: Alcott, Louisa May (1832-1888)
Primary Subject Work: Little Women (1868); 'The Freak of a Genius'
Classification: novel
Subject Terms:
treatment of gender; of genius; homosexuality

Document Information:
Publication Type: Journal Article
Language of Publication: English
...

In this case, the subject literature is American, because Alcott is an American author, and the period is 1800-1899, because Little Women was published in the nineteenth century.  Alcott is the primary subject author, and her works Little Women and "The Freak of a Genius" are the primary subject works, because those are the works analyzed in this article. The subject terms give us more information as to what this article is about; Stadler analyzes the treatment of gender, the treatment of genius, and the treatment of homosexuality. 

The subject terms included in MLAIB make searching the database much easier.  It's possible to find all the articles on Alcott or on Little Women, and it's even possible to do some searching according to the subject matter of the criticism; this article would be returned in a search on gender, even though the word "gender" is mentioned nowhere in the title. However, this sort of subject term is less consistently included throughout the database than the terms describing primary author, work, and national literature. Additionally, the vocabulary of subject terms has changed over time; some terms are no longer used, and others are new. Therefore, scholarly consideration of the terms used serves not only as a measure of what is of interest to the publishers of American Literature (and, presumably, their readers), but also the concerns of the bibliography and its field bibliographers. 

One more note on MLAIB: As of this writing, in February 2019, the Bibliography is available via three different vendors: Gale, EBSCO, and ProQuest. However, MLA has made a decision to make the Bibliography available exclusively through EBSCO in the future.*  The City University of New York subscribed to the Bibliography through Gale. In the wake of this decision, the EBSCO version of the Bibliography has been made available, but the Gale version has not yet been taken away. The content of the Bibliography is the same in each case, but Gale and EBSCO provide two very different interfaces with different affordances.** Thus, as a researcher, I had a choice as to which version of the database to use.  Despite my own preferences when I'm searching, this analysis will be based on data from the EBSCO version of the Bibliography, for the following reasons:

* The EBSCO interface will likely be the only version of the Bibliography available to future readers of this text.
* The EBSCO interface provides a more structured version of the record to be downloaded, distinguishing among the different types of terms.

As the record notes, the records of items in the Bibliography are copyrighted by the MLA, and, more particularly, so are the subject terms. Therefore, I will not be able to reproduce the entire dataset here, but a later section will describe how it was gathered.  I will, however, make the data that results from this analysis available under fair use. 

## _American Literature: A Journal of Literary History, Criticism, and Bibliography_

As its title suggests, _American Literature_ is "a journal of literary history, criticism, and bibliography, covering the works of American authors, past and present."  It is published by Duke University Press and is indexed in many databases, including those that cover literature and history. The journal is published quarterly, with new issues appearing in March, June, September and December. _American Literature_ has been published since 1929.

Almost any scholarly journal could be appropriate for the kind of analysis this project will perform.  However, _American Literature_ is a good choice because:

* It has a long publication history.  In this project, I'll be comparing the subject terms that have been applied to this journal at different time periods. This sort of analysis makes much less sense for younger journals.
*  _American Literature_ publishes a relatively high number of articles per issue, thus providing more data for my analysis.  
*  It is a well-known and well-respected journal with a broad focus and large readership, so it is likely more reflective of concerns in the broader field of American literature than a more specialized journal.
*  It is indexed in _MLAIB_.

Of course, because this project is focused on a single journal, it will not be able to compare the work done in _American Literature_ with the work in other journals about American literature.  I have selected records about this journal as data, so I will not be able to draw conclusions about the field as a whole. This is a limitation based on my own choices, but limiting the scope of my dataset in this way also helps to ensure that I'm working with a more manageable amount of data.

Other projects using this approach could look at a group of journals to make broader inferences about a field, or the criticism on a particular work or author (or a group of works or authors).  It would be possible to choose other years, or a larger number of years.  In each case, however, it is necessary to think about how much data a researcher can work with, considering the time and tools available to her, and choose the data that is most likely to answer that researcher's questions. 

## Scope Limitations: Three Years

Initially, I had hoped to look at decades rather than years. However, this proved to be more data than I could work with easily for a project of this scope.  Thus, I chose three sample years, 1950, 1980, and 2010. 

These sample years are thirty years apart, allowing time for shifts in the discipline to take place.  Additionally, they fall in the middle of American Literature's publication history: well after their first issue, which was published in 1939, but also well before the present day, which as of this writing is 2019.  

Regardless of the specific years chosen, I wanted to avoid working with current data, because it is more likely to change in the future.
