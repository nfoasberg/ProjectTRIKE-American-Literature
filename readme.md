# _American Literature_ in MLAIB: A Longitudial Look at Subject Terms

This repository is dedicated to the data from a project to analyze the subject terms for one journal in three different years in the MLA International Bibliography. 

Here, you will find:

- Records downloaded from MLA
- The subject headings, split out from the rest of the records
- An analysis of the ways these things have changed over time
- My narrative of how I did it

My analysis is based on the EBSCO interface of MLA, accessed through the [Queens College Libraries](https://library.qc.cuny.edu/)

Enjoy! 

Not yet, though. This isn't public yet.
