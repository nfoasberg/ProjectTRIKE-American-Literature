## About This Project

The dataset is a collection of records from the _MLA International Bibliography_ for the journal _American Literature_ for three different years, 2010, 1980, and 1950.  

### Research Questions

Although it is important to select your data with some knowledge of the questions you want to answer with it, research questions are still likely to shift over time, based on what you see in the data. When this happens, it's important to revisit the initial questions and think about whether the new questions can be answered using the same data.

In this case, I began gathering data with these questions in mind:

    1. How had the canon of American literature changed in the twentieth century? Are scholars writing about different authors now than they did previously? Is more attention being paid to women authors and authors of color? 
    2. Criticism changed drastically over the course of the twentieth century, with the emergence of many different schools of criticism. Are these differences visible from the metadata and subject indexing of the journal?
    3. How has the indexing in MLA shifted over time?  I expect to see _more_ subject terms per citation, but will I see different ones?

Note that several of these questions are bigger than the data that I've chosen to answer them. The question of canon in American literature will not be answered by one journal!  It also doesn't represent the breadth of the Bibliography. 

However, looking at one journal has its virtues:

    * Issues of a journal are likely to be similar in both subject matter and length.  I don't have to worry about comparing a journal that publishes 20 articles in an issue to one that publishes 4, or comparing a journal that's published quarterly to one that's only published anually.
    * Changes in this journal reflect what's happening between that journal and its readership. Suppose, for instance, that the number of different journals published has risen sharply at some point.  Many of the changes I'd see in the data would be because more journals are being published, and each of those journals would likely have a slightly different scope, readership, or editorial policies.  Note that I don't totally avoid this problem by sticking with one journal, as authors make choices about where to publish their work which are likely to be influenced by the other options available to them.
    * The amount of data I will collect is much more manageable.

So this makes sense as a place to start. In no case will a single project answer all of its own questions definitively! We work in the hope that others will find these questions interesting, and work on related projects that may also contribute to answer our questions.

### MLA International Bibliography_
_MLAIB_ is an index maintained by the Modern Language Association, a scholarly association for the study of language and literature. The index has strong coverage of the scholarly literature in these areas, including journals, books, and disserations. Coverage goes back to the 1920s.  Each entry includes specific metadata. Basic bibliographic information, including title, author, source (that is, place of publication), and ISSN or ISBN, is part of each record, along with "document information," including language, publication type, and accession number (a special number assigned to each record for ease of identifying it within the system). 

Additionally, each record includes a number of subject terms, which describe the content of the item described.  These subject terms, too, are structured.  Possible categories of subject terms include: Subject Literature [that is, national literature], Period [by century], Subject Author, Subject Work, and Subject Terms describing the ideas and themes which the work describes.  

Let's look at one example. This is the record for the following journal article:
Stadler, Gustavus. "Louisa May Alcott's Queer Geniuses." _American Literature: A Journal of Literary History, Criticism, and Bibliography_, vol. 71, no. 4, 1999, pp. 657-77.

In this case, the subject literature is American, because Alcott is an American author, and the period is 1800-1899, because _Little Women_ was published in the nineteenth century.  Alcott is the primary subject author, and her works _Little Women_ and "The Freak of a Genius" are the primary subject works, because those are the works analyzed in this article. The subject terms give us more information as to what this article is about; Stadler analyzes the treatment of gender, the treatment of genius, and the treatment of homosexuality. 

The subject terms included in MLAIB make searching the database much easier.  It's possible to find all the articles on Alcott or on _Little Women_, and it's even possible to do some searching according to the subject matter of the criticism; this article would be returned in a search on gender, even though the word "gender" is mentioned nowhere in the title. However, this sort of subject term is less consistently included throughout the database than the terms describing primary author, work, and national literature. Additionally, the vocabulary of subject terms has changed over time; some terms are no longer used, and others are new. Therefore, scholarly consideration of the terms used serves not only as a measure of what is of interest to the publishers of _American Literature_ (and, presumably, their readers), but also the concerns of the bibliography and its field bibliographers. 

One more note on _MLAIB_: As of this writing, in February 2019, the Bibliography is available via three different vendors: Gale, EBSCO, and ProQuest. However, MLA has made a decision to make the Bibliography available exclusively through EBSCO in the future.*  The City University of New York subscribed to the Bibliography through Gale. In the wake of this decision, the EBSCO version of the Bibliography has been made available, but the Gale version has not yet been taken away. The content of the Bibliography is the same in each case, but Gale and EBSCO provide two very different interfaces with different affordances.** Thus, as a researcher, I had a choice as to which version of the database to use.  Despite my own preferences when I'm searching, this analysis will be based on data from the EBSCO version of the Bibliography, for the following reasons:

    * The EBSCO interface will likely be the only version of the Bibliography available to future readers of this text.
    * The EBSCO interface provides a more structured version of the record to be downloaded. (explain this?)

As the record notes, the records of items in the Bibliography are copyrighted by the MLA, and, more particularly, so are the subject terms. Therefore, I will not be able to reproduce the entire dataset here, but a later section will describe how it was gathered.  I will, however, make some of the data with which I'm working available under fair use. 

### _American Literature: A Journal of Literary History, Criticism, and Bibliography_

As its title suggests, _American Literature_ is "a journal of literary history, criticism, and bibliography, covering the works of American authors, past and present."  It is published by Duke University Press and is indexed in many databases, including those that cover literature and history. The journal is published quarterly, with new issues appearing in March, June, September and December. _American Literature_ has been published since 1929.

Almost any scholarly journal could be appropriate for an analysis like the one I'll do in this project. I didn't need to choose _American Literature_ in particular.  However, it's a good choice because:

    * It has a long publication history.  In this project, I'll be comparing the subject terms that have been applied to this journal at different time periods. This sort of analysis makes much less sense for younger journals.
    *  _American Literature_ publishes a relatively high number of articles per issue, thus providing more data for my analysis.  
    *  It is a well-known and well-respected journal with a large readership, so it is likely more reflective of concerns in the broader field of American Literature than a more specialized journal.
    *  It is indexed in MLA.

Of course, because this project is focused on a single journal, it will not be able to compare the work done in _American Literature_ with the work in other journals about American literature.  I have selected records about this journal as data, so I will not be able to draw conclusions about the field as a whole. This is a limitation based on my own choices, but it also gives me a manageable amount of data to work with.  

Other projects using this approach could look at a group of journals to make broader inferences about a field, or the criticism on a particular work or author (or a group of works or authors).  It would be possible to choose other years, or a larger number of years.  In each case, however, it is necessary to think about _how much data_ a researcher can work with, considering the time and tools available to her, and choose the data that is most likely to answer that researcher's questions. 

### The Data

The data collected is in two formats. For each year, I have a marked up HTML file created by EBSCO's save function, and a more human-readable .txt file I created. As I work with the data, I will decide which one I can work with more easily.  The HTML file contains some metadata which might or might not be useful. 

Although each file covers a year's worth of articles published in this journal, they are not equal in number.  The number of articles is as follows:
1950: 37 articles
1980: 35 articles
2010: 24 articles

I plan to extract the subject terms for further examination.  The rest of the metadata will probably not be used in this project.

## Data Collection

### Three Years

Initially, I had hoped to look at decades rather than years. However, this proved to be more data than I could work with easily for a project of this scope.  Thus, I chose three sample years, 1950, 1980, and 2010. 

These sample years are thirty years apart, allowing time for shifts in the discipline to take place.  Additionally, they fall in the middle of _American Literature_'s publication history: well after their first issue, which was published in 1939, but also well before the present day, which for those keeping track at home is 2019.  

Regardless of the specific years chosen, I wanted to avoid working with current data, which might change in the future. 

### Accessing and Collecting the Data

My search in _MLAIB_ captures metadata _about_ this journal, rather than the journal itself. Thus, I am already at one remove from the articles themselves.  Most obviously, the Bibliography does not capture all content published in  _American Literature_. It indexes all the scholarly articles, but excludes book reviews. Among the scholarly articles, the journal distinguishes between longer articles and "Notes and Queries," but this information is not captured in the bibliography. Thus, while _MLAIB_ represents the scholarly content of this journal, it doesn't represent everythiing published there. More subtly, however, the way that the data is structured is also a representation by the Bibliography. 

 _MLAIB_ is a database with a graphic user interface (GUI). GUIs are relatively user-friendly and often straightforward, but they also limit what data a user is able to access.  

Above, we looked at the structure of a record in the Bibliography.  It's structured in a specific way; each piece of information gathered about the article is slotted into a particular category, like "author" or "subject term."  These categories are called "fields." 

Records in the bibliography constitute data for us, but looking at this record, it's clear that many choices have already been made.  When selecting which fields to include in a record, the editors of the bibliography decided what characteristics of an item are important enough to include in its description, and have structured the database around these decisions. This is why it's easy to ask questions about which authors are the subjects of articles, but much more difficult, for instance, to ask questions about which authors had mental illnesses. Please note that I am not necessarily making an argument for more comprehensive descriptions of articles here! There might be good reasons to make certain searches available and not others. However, it is always important to be cognizant of how data's availability is shaped by the decisions made when it was originally made available. 

Of course, there could also be a difference between the fields that exist in the database and the fields that are available for users to view and search. The vendor adds another layer of complexity; note that the Gale and EBSCO search interfaces use different language to describe the fields [screenshot?], and may in fact yield different results.***  There are subtle differences in the records for each interface. Most notably for our purposes, EBSCO breaks out the different types of subject terms, while Gale simply presents an unstructured list: ~~~~

**EBSCO:**
General Subject Areas:
Subject Literature: American literature
Period: 1800-1899
Primary Subject Author: Cooper, James Fenimore (1789-1851)
Primary Subject Work: The Pioneers (1823)
Classification: novel

Subject Terms:
treatment of privacy; relationship to law

**Gale:**

Subject Terms:American literature, 1800-1899; Cooper, James Fenimore (1789-1851); The Pioneers (1823); novel; treatment of privacy; relationship to law.

The structure behind the subject terms _exists_ and _can be searched_ in Gale. It is possible to do a "Person -- About" search (the equivalent of Primary Subject Author) for James Fenimore Cooper and come up with this article. However, this structure is not visible in the record itself. In short, when working with a GUI, not all the data is visible or available! In this case, the EBSCO structure is desirable because I can use it to analyze subject authors and works separately from the descriptive subject terms. 

As stated above, the scope of this project required that I retrieve the records for all the articles published in _American Literature_ in three separate years. I did three separate searches, one for each year. Because other journal titles may include the phrase "American literature," I searched by ISSN.  The EBSCO interface allows the user to add one page of results to the folder at a time, which was convenient for the size of the search.  From the folder, it is possible to save up to fifty results at a time (another strong argument against working with a larger dataset).

I saved each set of results in two different file formats, as I don't yet know which format will be the most useful. The details of this data are described above.


*Many librarians object strongly to this decision.
**The term "affordance", popularized by David Norman in his 1988 book, _The Design of Everyday Things_, refers to the actions that a tool enables.
