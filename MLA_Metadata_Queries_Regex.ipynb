      "Abstract:\n",
      "A brief burlesque of Mardi was published in The Man in the Moon in May, 1849. The anonymous burlesque, \"A Page by the Author of Mardi,\" parodies Melville's style and hits off his descriptions of the island of Mardi, the Narrator's frequent references to Jarl, the poetic anatomies of Yillah, and the epic proportions of the Narrator's quest. The Man in the Moon competed with Punch between 1847 and 1849. A number of talented journalists contributed to the monthly, but the author of the Mardi burlesque was probably Albert Smith, a popular social satirist. Smith mentions Melville in a comic poem that he wrote for The Town and Country Miscellany, which he edited in 1850. In this magazine he also published a humorous article on the sea, which contains a passage resembling the description of the sea in \"A Page by the Author of Mardi.\" By chance, Melville met Smith during his visit to London in 1849 and recorded his impression of him in his diary.\n",

      "It is known that Cooper owed a debt to John Jay for the story underlying The Spy. A letter of Jay's, dated 2 May 1781, to John Laurens, contains specific parallels to the historical setting and dramatic situation of The Pilot which suggest that Cooper was also indebted to Jay for an idea for the later novel. The lack of conflicting evidence in the published accounts of John Paul Jones's activities on the English coast, which Cooper used later for his Naval History, further confirms this indebtedness.\n",
